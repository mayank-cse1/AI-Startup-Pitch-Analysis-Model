# Welcome

AirBed&Breakfast™

Book rooms with locals, rather than hotels.


# Problem

Price is an important concern for customers booking travel online.

Hotels leave you disconnected from the city and its culture.

No easy way exists to book a room with a local or become a host.


# Solution

A web platform where users can rent out their space to host travelers to:

| SAVE MONEY | MAKE MONEY | SHARE CULTURE |
|---|---|---|
| when traveling | when hosting | local connection to the city |
